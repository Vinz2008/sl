# SL (Simple language)


## Ideas
- [ ] Write a good regex implementation and add it to the lang (see https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html)
- [ ] Use the linked yyjson to have a good json writer and reader in the language (change the flags for compiling yyjson)
- [ ] Pattern Matching
- [ ] Option type
- [ ] Functional constructs (map, filter, reduce, etc)
- [ ] Tuples
- [ ] bigInt type  (use gmp ? mpir ?)
